# Arch-Install-Guide
- This is a personal use and unprofessional guide of installing Arch Linux.
- This guide will use i3-gaps as window manager, and don't use any display manager. Which means, use tty as login shell, and manually type startx to start xorg server everytime.
- The guide will assume you have already prepared the usb to install the Arch, and have already get into the "tiny" arch window.
- Any <> appears in the command should be manually fixed and replaced by a suitable name.
